# School_shark_SWA
This repository contains scripts to reproduce analyses in De Wysiecki et al. (2022).

De Wysiecki AM, Irigoyen AJ, Cortés F, Bovcon ND, Milessi AC, Hozbor NM, Coller NM & Jaureguizar AJ. 2022. Population-scale habitat use of school sharks (Triakidae: Galeorhinus galeus) in the Southwest Atlantic: insights from temporally explicit niche modelling and habitat associations. Marine Ecology Progress Series 697, 81–95. https://doi.org/10.3354/meps14146 

Unfortunately, analyses (both modeling and habitat associations) cannot be fully reproduced from scratch because a fraction of occurrences have confidentiality agreements in place and could not be released. In the case of ENM models, however, these can be reproduced from the calibration step onwards using the calibration data.

Freely available occurrence data and all calibration data are available at https://www.int-res.com/articles/suppl/m697p081_supp/
