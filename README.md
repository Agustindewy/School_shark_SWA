This repository contains scripts to reproduce analysis in De Wysiecki et al. (in review).

Unfortunately, analyses (both modelling and habitat associations) cannot be fully reproduced because a fraction of occurrences have confidentiality agreements in place and could not be released.

Freely available occurrence data can be found in Appendix 3. Full calibration data is available in Appendix 4. Note ENM models can be fully reproduced from the calibration step onwards using the calibration data.

Please contact me at agustindewy@gmail.com if you have any questions.
