This repository contains scripts to reproduce analysis in De Wysiecki et al. (in review).

Unfortunately, analyses (both modelling and habitat associations) cannot be fully reproduced from scratch because a fraction of occurrences have confidentiality agreements in place and could not be released. In the case of ENM models, however, these can be reproduced from the calibration step onwards using the calibration data.

Freely available occurrence data and all calibration data are available in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KmtgirYt715Psbxy34KtFL1cW3g6mzB2?usp=sharing 

Please contact me at agustindewy@gmail.com if you have any questions.
